# Interview Questions

This repo contains `questions.md` - a markdown file containing mock interview coding questions.

### The Challenge

The challenge is to go through these questions, and **'whiteboard'** your solution.

What is whiteboarding? Essentially, grab a pen and paper, and see if you can solve these challenges without the use of google or your computer!

### After the Challenge

On the `solution` branch in this repo, I have uploaded a file - `solutions.md`.

After giving all these challenges a proper attempt, change to the `solution` branch, and see how you went!
